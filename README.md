To run the project on AWS, you'll need to follow several steps. The process involves deploying your application, setting up infrastructure, and configuring services. Below are the general steps you might take:

### 1. Set Up AWS Resources:
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):

Navigate to the infrastructure/terraform/ directory.
Run terraform init to initialize Terraform.
Run terraform apply to create the necessary AWS resources.
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes; type yes to proceed.

### 2. Deploy Backend (Server):
Docker:

Build Docker images for your server application.
bash
Copy code
cd docker/server/
docker build -t your-server-image .
AWS Lambda and API Gateway (Optional):

If you have AWS Lambda functions and API Gateway, deploy them using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

### 3. Deploy Frontend (Client):
Docker:

Build Docker images for your client application.
bash
Copy code
cd docker/client/
docker build -t your-client-image .

### 4. Deploy Kubernetes (Optional):
Kubernetes:

If you have Kubernetes configuration, apply the YAML files.
bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/

### 5. Set Up Monitoring:
Prometheus and Grafana:

Ensure that Prometheus and Grafana configurations are appropriate for your environment.
Deploy Prometheus and Grafana according to your chosen setup (e.g., using Docker, Kubernetes, or manual deployment).

### 6. Configure Jenkins (Optional):
Jenkins:

Set up a Jenkins server and configure it with the Jenkinsfile for continuous integration and deployment.

### 7. Running Your Application:
After setting up the necessary resources, your application should be accessible based on the configurations.
For server-based applications, ensure that the server is running and accessible via the configured endpoints.
For client-based applications, make sure the frontend is accessible through the configured URL or CDN.

### 8. Monitor and Troubleshoot:
Check Prometheus and Grafana dashboards for monitoring metrics.
Use AWS CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, or other monitoring tools for AWS-specific services.

### 9. Update and Maintenance:
Regularly update and maintain your application, infrastructure, and dependencies.
Monitor logs, metrics, and perform regular security audits.
Keep in mind that the exact steps might vary based on your specific technologies, services, and configurations. It's crucial to refer to the documentation of each tool, service, or platform you are using to ensure correct deployment and configuration. Additionally, always follow best practices for security and performance when deploying applications in a production environment.
